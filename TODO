[DONE] Create small sprites
[DONE] Create a verdict when they lose
[DONE] Add Sounds

Fix:
    [DONE] Pause the game when they lose and show text
    [DONE] then a key to press to restart the object's position

Bugs:
    When the player and the ball collide at the same position... the ball
    sometimes gets stuck.
